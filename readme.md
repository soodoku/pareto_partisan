John Bowen, a candidate seeking your party’s nomination for Congress in another state has made a new jobs plan the centerpiece of his campaign.  His plan has received a lot of media attention.  The bipartisan Congressional Budget Office has evaluated his plan and concluded it will help create jobs, but that the benefits will not be the same for all Americans.
