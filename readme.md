## Pareto Partisan: Are Partisans Willing to Bite Their Purse To Spite The Main Opposing Party?

One of the deepest concerns about group-based affect is that partisans will make policy choices motivated by spite. We fear that partisans will choose an option that is strictly worse for everyone as long as the opposing party supporters benefit less than co-partisans. We test this with two survey experiments on the CCES. We find that just a third of Democrats and a fourth of Republicans choose the plan that allocates the most money. The competing explanation for the results we see is that people do not like the government disbursing money for highways and hence opt for an option that allocates a smaller amount.
