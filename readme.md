## Pareto Partisan: Are Partisans Willing to Bite Their Purse To Spite The Main Opposing Party?

One of the deepest concerns about group-based affect is that partisans will take an option that is worse for everyone compared to an option that is better for everyone except where the supporters of the main opposing party benefit more than co-partisans. We test this with a survey experiment on the CCES. We find that just a third of the Democrats and a fourth of the Republicans choose the plan that allocates the most money.

We also asked a similar question that probes the policy consequences of racial affect.

John Bowen, a candidate seeking your party's nomination for Congress in another state has made a new jobs plan the centerpiece of his campaign.  His plan has received a lot of media attention. The bipartisan Congressional Budget Office has evaluated his plan and concluded it will help create jobs, but that the benefits will not be the same for all Americans. 

  Specifically, the report predicts that the average black family making \\$50,000 will see a 7 percent increase in income and the average white family making $50,000 will see a 5 percent increase in income.
