## Pareto Partisan: Are Partisans Willing to Bite Their Purse to Spite the Main Opposing Party?

One of the deepest concerns about group-based affect is that partisans will make policy choices motivated by spite. We fear that partisans will choose an option that is strictly worse for everyone as long as opposing party supporters get less than co-partisans. We test this on the CCES. When offered the choice between picking a highway plan that allocates $11B to co-partisan states and $12B to opposing partisan states and a plan that offers $10B to co-partisans and $9B to opposing partisans, we find that just a third of Democrats and a fourth of Republicans choose the more generous plan. The competing explanation for the results is that people do not like the government disbursing money for highways and hence opt for an option that allocates a smaller amount.

### Survey Question

We showed Democrats the first image and Republicans the latter and asked them: "Which plan do you support? Smith Plan or Williams Plan?" We randomized the order of responses.

### Future

John Bowen, a candidate seeking your party's nomination for Congress in another state has made a new jobs plan the centerpiece of his campaign.  His plan has received a lot of media attention. The bipartisan Congressional Budget Office has evaluated his plan and concluded it will help create jobs, but that the benefits will not be the same for all Americans. Specifically, the report predicts that the average **black (white)** family making \\$50,000 will see a 7 percent increase in income and the average **white (black)**family making $50,000 will see a 5 percent increase in income.

And then c.f. with where the gains are lower but reversed.

Based on this information, how likely would you be to vote for John in this primary? - Extremely Likely,
Very Likely, Somewhat Likely, Somewhat Unlikely, Very Unlikely, Extremely Unlikely
