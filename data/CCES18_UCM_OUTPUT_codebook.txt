UCM25                         Racial Resentment - Over the past few years, 
                              blacks have gotten less than they deserve.
UCM26                         Racial Resentment - Irish, Italian, Jewish, and 
                              many other minorities overcame prejudice and 
                              worked their way up. Blacks should do the same 
                              without any special favors.
UCM27                         Racial Resentment - It's really a matter of some 
                              people not trying hard enough; if blacks would 
                              only try harder they could be just as well off as 
                              whites.
UCM28                         Racial Resentment - Generations of slavery and 
                              discrimination have created conditions that make 
                              it difficult for blacks to work their way out of 
                              the lower class.

             35      1   I did not vote in the election this November.
             24      2   I thought about voting this time – but didn't.
             19      3   I usually vote, but didn't this time.
              8      4   I attempted to vote but did not or could not.
            706      5   I definitely voted in the Midterm Election on November 
                         6th.
